# Mini Python Projects

Welcome to the **Mini Python Projects** repository! üéâ

This repository contains a collection of small Python programs and scripts that I created while practicing and learning Python. Each project is designed to explore a different concept, from basic programming constructs to more advanced topics.

## üìÅ Projects Overview

Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the types of projects you'll find in this repository:

- **Beginner Projects**: Simple scripts covering basic Python topics like loops, conditionals, functions, and data structures.
   - **Random Password Generator**: A Python script that generates strong, random passwords with customizable length and character sets.
   - **QR Code Generator**: A Python script that creates QR codes from given text and saves them as PNG images.
   - **Countdown Timer**: A Python script that counts down from a specified number of seconds and displays the remaining time in minutes and seconds, updating every second until the timer completes.

- **Intermediate Projects**: Projects that involve libraries, file handling, and slightly more complex logic.
   - **Artist Information API**: A Python script that uses the Deezer API to search for an artist and retrieve a list of similar artists. The script queries the API to get artist details and related artists, providing recommendations based on the input artist's name.   

- **Advanced Projects**: More challenging exercises, possibly involving algorithms, data manipulation, or integrations with APIs.
